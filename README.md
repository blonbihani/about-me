#BIHANI TAMANG

##Current
I am a grad student at Northwest, studying Information Systems. I also work as a Grad Assistant in the school of Computer Science and Information Systems.

##Background
I come from a mountainous country, Nepal. I completed my undergraduate studies majoring in Information Management from Nepal. I'm fond of dancing and cooking.

##Plans
After I graduate, I hope to work as a Business/ Data Analyst and move to Texas/ Kansas City. After gaining hands on experience in those fields, I want to work in Project Management.
